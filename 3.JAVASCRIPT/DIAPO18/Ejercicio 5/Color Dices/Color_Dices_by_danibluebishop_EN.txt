Set of six sided dices images
======================================

There are two subsets inside this package:

	* One dice set with a resolution of 300 dpi
	* One dice set with a resolution of  72 dpi

Both sets have six images, one for each side in a dice, and they have been rendered in 5 different colors: green, blue, grey, pink and red.
