				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<cite>"Commonly used by frontline fighters, this reliable javelin has well-rounded offensive and defensive capabilities due to an even balance of armor and speed. The Ranger's propulsion pack can launch quick air strikes on unsuspecting foes, as well as navigate challenging terrain during exploration." – Suit description</cite>

				<p>All Freelancers train with the Ranger Javelin before moving onto other models. Not because it’s the easiest, but because it’s the most versatile. In the hands of a master pilot, the Ranger can achieve feats of combat prowess that no other Javelin can touch, and serves as the gold standard for combat efficiency. Likewise, Rangers are the go-to Javelin for Sentinels on the frontline.</p>

				<p>The Ranger has a deep bag of tricks to draw from, and there is no combat situation it can’t take on effectively. With access to every weapon type, the Ranger is a true wild card that can complement any team and any mission. Novice pilots will appreciate the wide array of weapons and abilities they can use to sharpen their skills, while experts gravitate toward the Ranger’s emphasis on excellent marksmanship and skill mastery.</p>
